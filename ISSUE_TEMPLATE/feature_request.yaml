        Thanks for helping improve this project, it's much appraciated.
        [!NOTE] To the attention of anyone willing to contribute or implement this feature (may be you!) [!NOTE]
        - [ ] Self-assign the issue
        - [ ] Propose a solution in the issue description / comments.
        - [ ] Wait for the status to be updated to `TODO` before you start the implementation.
        - [ ] Create a branch from the GitHub development panel and immediately create a Pull Request from that branch.
        Please make sure:
        - [ ] To write down your design / implementation choices. What worked, what did not or would not, why you chose this over that.
        - [ ] To implement extensive unit and/or integration tests. Or justify why they are not needed in the comments
        - [ ] To write required documentation
        - [ ] To create a new issue for any future __expected__ improvment and reference this one in the new issue description.
        Once done working on the implementation:
        - [ ] Rebase main in your branch (if needed).
        - [ ] Request a maintainer review from the PR.
        [!NOTE] If you have any questions or need guidance, feel free to add related labels and ping a maintainer [!NOTE]

        ## SCORING
        [!NOTE]
          Priority Formula: _impact * effort * complexity_
          Contribution Formula: _impact * 0.5 * complexity * (actually merged) effort_.
          Effort being computed this way: max(additions, deletions)
        [!NOTE]

    id: impact
    attributes:
      label: Impact
      description: How many users would benefit from this feature and how big would the impact be? `average(reach, impact)`
      options:
        - Negligible impact | Benefits really few users
        - Interesting feature | Benefits a fair proportion of users
        - Non-blocking but essential feature | Every user will benefit from having this feature.
        - This feature is a prerequisite for other essential features | Would have no user without this feature.
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: dropdown
    id: effort
    attributes:
      label: Effort
      description: Select the estimated number of lines of code `max(additions, deletions)`. Do not take complexity into account.
      options:
        - "-200 LoC"
        - "-750 LoC"
        - "-1k5 LoC"

    attributes:
      label: Complexity
      description: How complex do you think the problem resolution will be? Consider factors such as algorithmic, brainfuck, and uncertainty. Do not take lines of code into account
      options:
        - Easy. Use of brain cells is mostly null.
        - Manageable. Will require hours of research / experimentation.
        - Hard. Will require days of research / experimentation, __prior to implementation__.
        - Black Magic level. May require weeks of research / experimentation, __prior to implementation__. May even be unsolvable.
