# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?

To the attention of the assignee

## About new features and enhancements submissions

### ùüè - If you want to implement this enhancement yourself

- Self-assign the issue
- Propose a solution in the issue description / comments.
- Set the appropriate _status_: `BACKLOG` or `ACTIVE` (if actually working on the implementation)
- Create a branch from the GitHub development panel and start working on it.

### 2 - Implementation rules

- Have your design / implementation choices been written down in comments? What worked, what did not or would not, why you chose this over that.
- Have you implemented unit and/or integration tests? Or justify why they are not needed in the comments.
- Have you written documentation? Make sure anyone else working over your code can understand it.
- Make sure to create a new issue for any future **expected** improvement and reference this one in the new issue description.

### 3 - Once done working on the implementation

- Create a Pull Request from your branch.
- Set issue _status_ to `REVIEW`.
- _Request review_ from a maintainer. Once reviewed, rebase main into your branch to avoid conflicts or regressions.
