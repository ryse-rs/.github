# WHAT IS OUR VISION ABOUT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT?

See [GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/ryse-rs/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

There, you will learn more about project / issues / PR / GitHub / Code management.

We also have a scoring system (yet to automate).

# HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE?

See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/ryse-rs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This document is really important as it clearly defines every step you must cover in order to get any code modification into the main branch.
