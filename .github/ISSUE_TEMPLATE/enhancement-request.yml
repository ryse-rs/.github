        ## Priority - Score

        ### Impact

        _How many users would benefit from this enhancement and how big would the impact be? (`average(reach, impact)`)_

        - [ ] I1 - Negligible impact | Benefits really few users
        - [ ] I2 - Interesting enhancement | Benefits a fair proportion of users
        - [ ] I3 - Non-blocking but essential enhancement | Every user will benefit from having this enhancement.
        - [ ] I4 - This enhancement is a prerequisite for other essential enhancements | Would have no user without this enhancement.

        ### Complexity

        _How complex do you think the problem resolution will be? Consider factors such as algorithmic, brainfuck, novelty, experimentation and uncertainty. Do not take lines of code into account_.

        - [ ] C1 - Easy. Use of brain cells is mostly null.
        - [ ] C2 - Manageable. Will require hours of research / experimentation.
        - [ ] C3 - Hard. Will require days of research / experimentation, **prior to implementation**.
        - [ ] C4 - Black Magic level. May require weeks of research / experimentation, **prior to implementation**. May even be unsolvable.

        ### Effort

        _Select the estimated number of lines of code (`max(additions, deletions)`). Do not take complexity into account._

        - [ ] E1 - < 200 LoC
        - [ ] E2 - < 750 LoC
        - [ ] E3 - < 1k5 LoC
        - [ ] E4 - >= 1k5 LoC

        > [!NOTE] > **Priority Formula** ➧ `impact * effort * complexity` > **Contribution Formula** ➧ `impact * 0.5 * complexity * (actually merged) effort`
        > Effort being computed this way: `max(additions, deletions)`

        ### To the attention of the request author

        - [ ] Ask a maintainer to consider adding it to the `BACKLOG`.
        - [ ] I'd like to implement this myself.

        ### To the attention of the assignee

        #### 1 - On Github

        - [ ] Self-assign the issue
        - [ ] Propose a solution in the issue description / comments.
        - [ ] Set the appropriate _status_: `BACKLOG` (if ready) or `ACTIVE` (if actually working on the implementation)
        - [ ] Create a branch from the GitHub development panel and start working on it.

        #### 2 - On Code

        - [ ] Write design / implementation choices down in comments.
        - [ ] Unit and/or integration tests? Or justify why not in comments.
        - [ ] Documentation. Make sure anyone else working over your code can understand it.
        - [ ] Make sure to create a new issue for any future **expected** improvement and reference this one in the new issue description.

        #### 3 - On Github

        - [ ] Create a Pull Request from your branch.
        - [ ] Set the _status_ of the issue to `REVIEW`.
        - [ ] Request the review from a maintainer. Once reviewed, rebase main in your branch (if needed).
        - [ ] Set the _status_ of the issue to `DONE`.
