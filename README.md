Default bug report, enhancement and feature request github templates to be used by any repository.

- Check this: https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file#supported-file-types
- GitHub automatically [links PRs and issues together](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) by using specific `keyword #issue-number`

# WHAT IS OUR VISION ABOUT SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT?

See [GOVERNANCE](https://github.com/ryse-rs/.github/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).

There, you will learn more about project / issues / PR / GitHub / Code management.

We also have a scoring system (yet to automate).

# HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE?

See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/ryse-rs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This document is really important as it clearly defines every step you must cover in order to get any code modification into the main branch.
