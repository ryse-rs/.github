- **Project boards** to manage priorities
- **Issue scoring** to evaluate impact, urgency, and effort
- Automated **CI/CD pipelines** for validation
- GitHub **Keywords** to link PRs to issues (`Fixes #...`, `Closes #...`)
- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format.

## 📋 Issue Templates

All repositories support unified templates for:

- 🐛 [Bug Reports](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml)
- 🚀 [Feature Requests](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.yml)

These templates help us triage faster and build better software together.
